The Indoor Wayfinding System is a web-based application designed to help students, staff, and visitors navigate the inside the building more efficiently.
The system provides clear directions to classrooms, offices, and other important facilities through interactive maps.The system includes several key features designed to enhance indoor navigation. A search bar allows users to quickly find specific rooms by name or number. The point button enables users to set their current location on the map and view the route to a selected room. A floor selection dropdown makes it easy to switch between different building floors, with the map updating automatically when navigating to a room on another level. On the left side, a room list panel provides quick access to all available rooms. At the center, an interactive map supports pan and zoom functionality, allowing users to explore the building layout with ease.
